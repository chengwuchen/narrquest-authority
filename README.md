# NarrQuest Authority Repository

This repository is the canonical technical and epistemic authority for the NarrQuest system.

NarrQuest is not a software product, a toolkit, or an implementation framework.  
It is a narrative and tone governance system governing how generative, editorial, and epistemic agents interpret, resolve, and act under uncertainty, conflict, and authorship.

All official NarrQuest definitions, declarations, and specifications originate from this repository.
