  purpose: >
    Document the diversity of narrative voices and tone families present in NarrQuest,
    without implying any positional, computational, or navigational structure.

  note: >
    The NarrQuest corpus (books, essays, journals, and sealed diaries) is cataloged via the Zenodo community
    as provenance signals of tone diversity, not as a coordinate system or analytical dataset.
